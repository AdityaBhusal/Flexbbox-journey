# flexbox
> this is my journey as a learner of CSS flexbox. it is not a ideal document that everyone should follow but the documentation of my flexbox journey.I took the  important topics and summarized in this documentation.

 Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container.

To use it, give an element a display property of flex. This will make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.

Example: 
```html
    *{
        display: flex; 
    }
```
## *flex-direction*
Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the *flex-direction* property, which has four possible values:

**row** (default) - horizontal axis with flex items from left to right.

**row-reverse** - horizontal axis with flex items from right to left.

**column** - vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom.

**column-reverse** - vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top.

>Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.

## *flex-wrap*
>determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small
*  *wrap* - allows the items to wrap to the next row or column
*   *nowrap **(default)*** - prevents your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.

## *justify-content*
  >determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them
* *center* - aligns the space around it to make the content in the center of the page
  
## align-items
> positions the flex content along the cross axis

* *normal	**(default)*** - behaves like
* *stretch* - items are stretched to fit the container
* *center* - items positioned at center of the flexbox container
* *flex-start* - items positioned at the beginning of the container
* *flex-end* - items positioned at the end of the container
* *start* - items positioned at the beginning of their individual grid cells, in block direction
* *end* - items positioned at the end of their individual grid cells, in block direction
* *baseline* - items positioned at the baseline of the container
* *initial* - sets the property to default value
* *inherit* - inherits the property from parent element

## *object-fit*
> **The object-fit property defines how an element responds to the height and width of its content box. Itâ€™s intended for images, videos and other embeddable media formats in conjunction with the object-position property. Used by itself, object-fit lets us crop an inline image by giving us fine-grained control over how it squishes and stretches inside its box.**

* ***fill***(default):  stretches the image to fit the content box, regardless of its aspect-ratio

* ***contain***: increases or decreases the size of the image to fill the box whilst preserving its aspect-ratio 

* ***cover***: the image will fill the height and width of its box, once again maintaining its aspect ratio but often cropping the image in the process

* ***none***: image will ignore the height and width of the parent and retain its original size

* ***scale-down***: image will compare the difference between none and contain in order to find the smallest concrete object size.

## *gap*
defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout
* shorthand for the *row-gap* and *column-gap* property

```css
gap: 20px 50px; 
/*gap of 20 px in row and 50 px in column (both grid and flexbox)*/
```

## *pseudo-element*
  *pseudo element is not an exclusive property of flexbox but this is one of the most important properties used in css.*

* is used to : 
  * style specified parts of an element
  * insert content ***before***, or ***after***, the content of an element

  ### syntax
  ``` css
  selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
  }
  ```

* all the pseudo-elements used in CSS are listed below:
  
    * ***after:*** insert something after the content of the element
    * ***before:*** insert something before the content of the element
    * ***first-letter:*** selects the first letter of the element
    * ***first-line:*** selects the first-line of the element
    * ***marker:*** selects the markers of list items 
    * ***selection:*** selects the portion of an elemnent that is selected by a user.
